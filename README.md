# Simple-Portal-Connected-with-Opeb-AI-to-generate-Audio-and-Video
We are looking to develop a simple portal connected with OpenAI services.

We'll be able to upload the document and give the prompts to look into that document and generate the content based on that prompt looking into the document.

The content is going to be like a script for next step. This generated script can be altered and then used to generate the video using AI models like OpenAI Sora.

The generated video can be longer in length so if it is not feasible to generate the single video, it should generate in parts and stitch the videos.

The AI should also generate the audio from that script and that voiceover can be clubbed with the video to generate the complete video

We will provide the document to the tool, and then we will ask it to create a video for us. The tool will generate a script from the document, along with a voiceover and a video. It will also merge the audio and video together, meaning we will get three outputs: audio, video, and the combined audio-video.
-----------
To develop the simple portal that integrates OpenAI services for document-based content generation (i.e., script generation, video, and audio synthesis), you'll need multiple components. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how this can be implemented using Python and FastAPI for the web framework, OpenAI for text generation, and libraries like gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for generating audio. We'll also look into video generation and stitching, though this can be simplified using external services or libraries like moviepy.
Step-by-Step Approach

    User Uploads Document: The user uploads a document to the portal.
    OpenAI Script Generation: The portal reads the document and generates a script based on a prompt.
    Audio Generation: Convert the generated script into speech (voiceover).
    Video Generation: Use AI models (like OpenAI Sora, or another service) to generate video segments based on the script.
    Merge Audio and Video: Combine the generated audio and video segments, possibly using moviepy or another video processing tool.
    Output: Provide the user with three outputs: audio, video, and combined audio-video.

Code Implementation
1. Install Required Libraries

Make sure to install the necessary libraries:

pip install fastapi openai moviepy gtts uvicorn

    FastAPI: For creating the web application.
    openai: To interact with OpenAI's GPT model.
    moviepy: To handle video processing (e.g., stitching videos).
    gtts: To convert generated scripts into audio.
    uvicorn: For running the FastAPI application.

2. Python Code for FastAPI and OpenAI Integration

Below is the Python code for the backend of the portal:

import os
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import openai
from moviepy.editor import concatenate_videoclips, VideoFileClip, AudioFileClip
from gtts import gTTS

app = FastAPI()

# OpenAI API setup
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"  # Replace with your OpenAI API key

# Pydantic model for receiving the prompt and document upload
class ScriptRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    document_name: str


@app.post("/generate-video/")
async def generate_video(request: ScriptRequest, file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        # Save the uploaded document to a temporary file
        temp_file_path = f"./temp_files/{uuid.uuid4()}_{file.filename}"
        os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(temp_file_path), exist_ok=True)

            f.write(content)

        # Read the document content
        with open(temp_file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            document_content = f.read()

        # Generate the script using OpenAI
        prompt = request.prompt + "\n\n" + document_content
        script = generate_script_from_openai(prompt)

        # Generate audio for the script using gTTS
        audio_path = generate_audio(script)

        # Generate video segments (dummy video creation for this example)
        video_path = generate_video_from_script(script)

        # Combine audio and video (dummy logic)
        combined_video_path = combine_audio_and_video(video_path, audio_path)

        # Clean up the temporary files
        os.remove(temp_file_path)
        os.remove(audio_path)

Explanation of Code:

    FastAPI Setup:
        We define a FastAPI app with a POST endpoint (/generate-video/) that accepts a document and a prompt to generate a script, audio, video, and a combined output.

    OpenAI Script Generation:
        The prompt and document are passed to OpenAI’s GPT engine to generate a script for the video.

    Audio Generation:
        We use gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to generate an MP3 audio file from the script.

    Video Generation:
        For simplicity, a dummy video is created using MoviePy, which can later be replaced by an AI model that generates dynamic video content.

    Audio-Video Combination:
        The audio is combined with the video. If the audio is shorter than the video, it loops until the video duration is met.

Running the Application:

You can run the application using uvicorn:

uvicorn main:app --reload

Google Cloud Deployment:

To deploy this to Google Cloud Run, follow these steps:

    Dockerize the Application:
        Create a Dockerfile for this application.
    Create Dockerfile:

FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]

    Deploy to Google Cloud Run:
        Build, push to Google Container Registry, and deploy to Cloud Run as discussed in the previous responses.

Conclusion:

This solution integrates OpenAI with FastAPI, allowing you to upload a document, generate a script, and use that script to produce audio, video, and combined media.
